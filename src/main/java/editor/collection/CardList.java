/**
 * This class represents a collection of cards.  Each card should be represented by a single entry
 * that keeps track of information such as how many copies are in the CardList.  If an implementation
 * of Card list doesn't do this, that should be noted by its documentation.
 * <p>
 * This does not implement {@link Collection}<Card>, {@link List}<Card>, or {@link Set}<Card> because
 * its behavior for add and remove are slightly different than any of them.  For example, if a card is
 * added twice, it should only take up one place in the list (like Set), but when if it is removed once,
 * it should still be part of the CardList (like List).  It doesn't implement {@link Collection}<Card>
 * because Collection is bound by legacy definitions like remove taking an Object and not being generic.
