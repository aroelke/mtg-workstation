# MTG Workstation
This is a Magic: the Gathering deck editor that supports custom categories for cards in decks.

Magic: the Gathering is owned by Wizards of the Coast, to which I have no affiliation.

This depends on MTGJSON (http://www.mtgjson.com/) for its card list.

### Prerequisites
 - `sbt`: https://www.scala-sbt.org/
 - JDK 16 or newer: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/

### Running
From the command line, install prerequisites and then run `sbt run`.

On Windows, each release also has a standalone installer that doesn't require any prerequisites.
